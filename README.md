Home assistant monkey patches
=============================

Example custom_component to monkey patch a library.

The example includes a monkey patch for from `async_upnp_client.aiohttp.AiohttpSessionRequester.async_http_request` from [async_upnp_client](https://github.com/StevenLooman/async_upnp_client).

This is not supported by me or Home Assistant itself by any means. This is merely meant as an example. Please do not create issues or pull requests.
